# Formal Verification

## 1. Introduction

This is a collection of assignments for the course of CMPT 777: `Introduction to Formal Verification`. The assignments include:

- Use `Z3 theorem prover` to check the `satisfiability` of logical formulas. Specifically, we need to write a `Java` program with `Z3 APIs` to solve the graph coloring problem [Code](/P1/GraphColoringSAT/src/cmpt/GraphColoring.java) [Report](/P1/P1_Sihui_Wang.pdf);
- Write a `Java` program with `Z3 APIs` to solve the `Sudoku` problems [Code](/P2/Sudoku/src/cmpt/Sudoku.java) [Report](/P2/P2_Sihui_Wang.pdf);
- Write `Dafny` programs to verify that certain algorithms can ensure that some conditions are satisfied [Code](/P3/P3_Sihui_Wang.dfy) [Report](/P3/P3_Sihui_Wang.pdf).

**Topics:** _Formal Verification_

**Skills:** _Java_, _Z3 theorem solver_, _Dafny_
